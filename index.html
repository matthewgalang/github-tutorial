	<h2>How to use Git on a Daily Basis:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>git pull to sync with current repository</li>
		<li>git branch branchname</li>
		<li>git checkout branchname</li>
		<li>Make edits and changes on local files</li>
		<li>git status</li>
		<li>git add filesthatwerechanged OR git add -A</li>
		<li>git commit -m "description"</li>
		<li>git push</li>
		<li>git checkout masterbranch</li>
		<li>Go to github to make pull request</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>If you don't commit with a description. You'll get a CLI error. To escape it, press esc key and enter ":wq"</p>
	<p>NEVER MAKE A HABIT OF WORKING DIRECTLY ON THE MAIN BRANCH. ALWAYS MAKE A SEPARATE BRANCH AND NAME IT PROPERLY.</p>
	<p>When in a branch, use "git pull" to update the branch to the branching node you're working on (if working on edits to master branch or working branch)</p>
	<p>After pushing edits on a branch, go to github to submit pull request and wait for coding review.</p>
	<p>If pull request is completed and reviewed, the request can be merged with the master branch or completed node.</p>
	<p>Conflicts in code have to be worked on outside of code F2F. Whichever version of the code is agreed on can be submitted as a commit on the branch.</p>
